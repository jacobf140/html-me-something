          <h2>How I Began:</h2>
          <p1>I first began learning guitar in 2012. Since then I have been self teaching myself. Ever since I began I have loved to venture into different genres of music and see what I can adopt from them to apply in my "natural" playing.

          <h2>My Future Plans:</h2>
          <p1>My hope is to be able to eventually be able to produce from a studio of my own possibly. Closer future plans of mine are more along the lines of getting a home stuido together to then study further into the recording and mixing process.</p1>
